Code for the course project from coursera course cleaning data

This code describes how to create a tidy data set answering to the requests from the course project. I did not manage to accomplish neither step 2 and 5. Besides, the read.table function was not working for the X_train.txt and X_test.txt and I converted them to csv files in order to be able to read them.

I did not manage to perform step 2 because I do not know how to save only the variables containing mean or sd in their names. Should it be indicated manually numerical/deleting the columns directly?

I would like to calculate the average by activity and subject, should the tapply function be used with a for or a while and going through all the other variables? I did not find a wise way of approaching neither steps 2 and 5 as you can see.
